Lokesh Shah</strong></p>\n\n<p>Mobile Number -&nbsp;8000647068</p>\n\n<p>Email id -&nbsp;lokesh@gujreraexperts.com</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the realm of real estate, numerous terms are associated with residential complexes. One such term that frequently approaches is &#39;common area.&#39; Simply put, a common area refers to a shared space within a residential or commercial complex that is collectively funded by all its residents. In this context, every &nbsp;owner in the Project is considered a co-owner of these communal spaces, and the ownership is distributed equally among all the residents.</p>\n\n<p>If a Developer /Promoter offers you the super-built area of a house, the entire area, including the common areas, is included in it. <strong>As per section &nbsp;2(n) of the &nbsp;RERA Act, 2016, &ldquo;Common Area&rdquo; includes:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The entire land for the real estate project, or if the project is developed in phases and registration under the RERA is sought for a phase, the entire land for that particular phase.</li>\n\t<li>Staircases, lift, elevators, elevator lobbies, fire escapes, and common entrances and exits of buildings.</li>\n\t<li>Common terraces and basements, parks, play areas, open parking areas, and common storage spaces.</li>\n\t<li>The premises for lodging of persons who are employed for the management of the property, including accommodation for watchmen and ward staff, or for the lodging of community service personnel.</li>\n\t<li>All community and commercial facilities as provided in the real estate project.</li>\n\t<li>Installations of central services such as electricity, gas, water and sanitation, air-conditioning and incineration, and systems for water conservation and renewable energy.</li>\n\t<li>Water tanks, pumps, motors, compressors, fans, ducts, and all apparatus connected with installations for common use.</li>\n\t<li>Other portions of the project necessary or convenient for its maintenance, safety, etc. and in common use.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Not only RERA but Apartment Act also have some guidelines for common area:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Before the association of allotters takes over, the developer is responsible for preserving common areas.</li>\n\t<li>The responsibility for the common area maintenance falls to all members of society.</li>\n\t<li>The landlord is liable for the maintenance of the common areas in the case of commercial property.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When it comes to an area that is shared by all there are various questions attached to it. We offers you answer to all your queries as follow:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Who&rsquo;s Responsible for the Maintenance of the Common Area?</strong></p>\n\n<p>All allottees are equally accountable for open areas and their maintenance. The Real Estate Act (RERA) specifies that it should be the responsibility of every allottee to make payments to maintain the property and the premises. All citizens collect a stipulated fee and this goes towards operational expenses undertaken to protect the community areas.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Can It Be Possible to Inherit and Pass Common Area?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No, It is not possible to inherit or transfer common areas and facilities by sale, mortgage, lease, gift, or swap, along with an undivided interest in common areas to any third party. The reference may be made to the decision of this Court in case of <a href=\"https://www.casemine.com/judgement/in/56e66a98607dba6b53436781\">Harikrushnadas Chhaganlal, Nanalal &amp; Ishwardas Mohanlal Seva Samaj Trust v. Vinodchandra G. Vaghela</a> reported in <strong>2010 (2) GLR 1820</strong> wherein at paras 4, 5 and 6 it was observed as under:</p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;4.</strong> It is an admitted fact that the society has sold the land of the common plot to the petitioner. It can hardly be disputed that the land of the common plot in any residential society is meant for common use and common purposes of all members of the society, and all members of the society, so far as common plot and common facilities and common area are concerned, they are holding joint and common interest in such portion. It is not the case of the respondent society that the land has been permitted to be used for creating of any common facilities for the members of the society.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. If you are not using common areas and services, do you pay maintenance charges?</strong></p>\n\n<p>According to the Apartment act, &lsquo;No apartment owners may exempt themselves from liability for their contribution towards the common expenses by waiver of the use or enjoyment of any of the common areas and facilities or by the abandonment of their apartment&rsquo; In simple words, &lsquo;yes&rsquo; it is mandatory for all to pay maintenance charges.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>5.&nbsp;Common Area to be utilized by all members.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the Gujarat RERA &nbsp;judgement for the case law of Members of <strong>Nilkanth Villa Vs. Pari Infra</strong>, it was enacted that :</p>\n\n<p>A Common area between two concerned Projects was separated by a compound wall, and thus the common area was divided , and was the cause of complaint between the members of both the Projects, &nbsp;but later on through the Order of the Hon&rsquo;ble Authority , the common compound wall was ordered to be demolished and the common area was allowed to be used by both the Project members.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. How Can Common Areas Be Identified?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Information on the property on which the building was constructed and the common areas and amenities must be included in the sale documents of the apartment and its registration papers. It should also note whether the property is freehold property or leasehold and whether the lease period is a leasehold property. It should also include the percentage of an undivided interest in the common areas and services relating to the apartment. It must also explain the restricted common areas and services.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Can Members Parking can be sold ?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Open Parking cannot be sold to the any particular allottee, as the open &nbsp;parking is considered as the common area as per the definition of &ldquo;<strong>Common area</strong>&rdquo;as per RERA Act. But covered parking is not considered as a part of the common area and thus it &nbsp;can be sold..</p>\n\n<p>Maharashtra &nbsp;Real Estate Regulatory Authority in the Complaint No. <strong>CC006000000089761</strong> &ndash; &nbsp;in the matter of Mr. Deepesh S Singh &nbsp;Vs M/s. Neelkanth Constructions &nbsp;, Ordered that &ldquo;With regard to the car parking, the MahaRERA directs that the respondent is entitled to sell only covered car parking and no cash money be demanded from the allottees.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>8. Is It Possible to Sell Common Roof Rights Through a Developer?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Giving or selling exclusive rights to the terrace or rooftop is an unethical activity in a housing society. All other common terraces belong to a resident unless the terrace is attached to a unit. A terrace, if inaccessible from common areas, is private. It is not possible to buy or sell common terrace space and is, thus, not included in the floor area ratio (FAR).</p>\n\n<p>We trust that this article has addressed your inquiries regarding the common area.

Fractional Ownership in the Indian Real Estate Sector</strong></h3>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />\nIn the bustling city of Mumbai, India, renowned for its dynamic real estate market, a landmark residential project named &quot;Mumbai Residency&quot; introduced a pioneering approach to property ownership through fractional ownership. This development, valued at INR 200 million, sought to address the challenges of affordability and accessibility faced by potential investors in one of the country&#39;s most sought-after real estate markets.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fractional Ownership Structure:</strong><br />\nA Mumbai-based real estate platform, &quot;IndiaShares,&quot; initiated the fractional ownership model for Mumbai Residency. The property was divided into 100,000 shares, with each share representing a portion of ownership. Interested investors could participate with an investment as low as INR 10,000, breaking down the traditional barriers to entry in the Mumbai real estate scene.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Investor Profile:</strong><br />\nIndiaShares attracted a diverse group of investors, including young professionals, expatriates, and seasoned investors looking to diversify their portfolios. The fractional ownership model appealed to those who aspired to own a piece of Mumbai&#39;s real estate market but found sole ownership financially challenging.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Advantages for Investors:</strong><br />\n<strong>Affordable Entry: </strong>The fractional ownership model allowed investors to enter the competitive Mumbai real estate market with a minimal investment, providing an opportunity for a more extensive demographic to participate.<br />\n<strong>Diversification:</strong> Investors leveraged fractional ownership to diversify their real estate holdings, spreading their investments across multiple properties to mitigate risk.<br />\n<strong>Potential Returns:</strong> As Mumbai Residency appreciated in value, investors experienced proportional returns. Rental income generated from leased units was distributed among shareholders based on their ownership percentage.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Management and Decision-Making:</strong><br />\nIndiaShares collaborated with a local property management company to oversee day-to-day operations, maintenance, and tenant interactions. Decision-making was facilitated through a digital platform, ensuring transparent communication and allowing shareholders to vote on key matters related to the property.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Challenges and Solutions:</strong><br />\n<strong>Regulatory Compliance: </strong>Negotiating India&#39;s complex regulatory landscape for real estate required IndiaShares to work closely with legal experts. Strict adherence to local laws ensured investor confidence and regulatory compliance.<br />\n<strong>Educational Initiatives: </strong>Recognizing the novelty of fractional ownership in India, IndiaShares invested in educational initiatives to inform potential investors about the model&#39;s benefits, risks, and legal aspects, fostering a greater understanding within the market.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Outcomes:</strong><br />\nThe fractional ownership model for Mumbai Residency proved successful. Investors enjoyed capital appreciation, received rental income, and experienced the pride of ownership in a prime Mumbai location. The project&#39;s success sparked interest from other developers and platforms, signaling a potential shift in the traditional real estate landscape.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Impact on the Indian Real Estate Market:</strong><br />\nIndiaShares&#39; fractional ownership model set a precedent in the Indian real estate market. The success of Mumbai Residency inspired other developers to explore similar models, promoting inclusivity and democratizing property ownership in a market known for its high entry barriers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br />\nThis case study exemplifies how fractional ownership can address affordability challenges, open doors for a diverse investor base, and reshape the dynamics of the real estate market in India.

It&#39;s a holistic approach that integrates innovation, technology, and community engagement to create living spaces that not only minimise environmental impact but actively contribute to a regenerative and thriving ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Smart Sustainability: &#39;Greenovation&#39; embraces the synergy between smart technologies and sustainability.

From digital platforms offering real-time energy consumption insights to community workshops on eco-friendly practices, we aim to empower residents with the knowledge to make informed and sustainable decisions.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Adapting to Changing Needs: The world is dynamic, and so are the needs of its inhabitants. &#39;Greenovation&#39; acknowledges this by creating spaces that adapt to changing lifestyles and environmental conditions.

Understanding color psychology helps create spaces that align with your preferences and desired ambience.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Start by considering the primary function of each room. For example, calming tones like blues and greens are ideal for bedrooms, promoting relaxation and restful sleep. In contrast, vibrant hues such as yellows and oranges work well in areas meant for socializing, like the living room, fostering energy and warmth.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Neutral colors like beige, grey, and white serve as versatile foundations, allowing you to experiment with accent colors. They create a timeless backdrop and offer flexibility for changing styles or preferences over time.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Warm colors like reds and yellows can add coziness and intimacy to a space, making them suitable for dining rooms or areas where you want to encourage conversation. However, it&#39;s essential to balance warm tones with cooler ones to prevent the space from feeling too intense.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Cool colors, such as blues and greens, evoke a sense of calmness and tranquillity. These are excellent choices for spaces where relaxation is a priority, like bathrooms or reading nooks. Various shades within the cool color spectrum can add depth and interest to the design.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Consider the size and lighting of each room. Lighter colors can make a small room feel more spacious, while darker hues create a more intimate atmosphere in larger spaces. Pay attention to natural light, as it can influence how colors appear throughout the day.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Texture plays a role in color perception as well. Matte finishes absorb more light, giving colors a softer appearance, while glossy finishes reflect light, making colors more vibrant. Experimenting with textures can enhance the overall visual appeal of your chosen color palette.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Harmony is key when combining colors. Analogous color schemes involve selecting colors that are adjacent on the color wheel, creating a cohesive and serene look. Complementary color schemes involve pairing colors from opposite sides of the wheel, providing high contrast and vibrancy.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t overlook the psychological impact of neutrals. White signifies purity and cleanliness, making it a popular choice for bathrooms and kitchens. Beige is associated with warmth and stability, making it a versatile option for various rooms.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Bold accent colors can be introduced through accessories, artwork, or furniture. This allows you to inject personality into your space without committing to an entire room painted in a bold hue. Consider the emotional response you want to evoke when choosing these accents.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, personal preferences should guide your color choices. Your home reflects your style and personality, so choose colors that resonate with you. Sample paint colors in small sections of the wall to see how they interact with the room&#39;s lighting before committing to a full application.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Hence, color psychology is a powerful tool in interior design. By understanding the emotional and visual impact of different colors, you can create a home that not only looks appealing but also supports the desired atmosphere for each room.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5><span style=\"color:#bdc3c7;\">-Hardi Shah</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n","seo_title":"Choosing the right color palette","seo_description":"Understanding color psychology helps create spaces that align with your preferences and desired ambience.

The use of energy-efficient technologies, sustainable construction materials, and waste reduction not only lessens the environmental impact but also significantly cuts down on operational costs in the long term. A study by the Urban Land Institute highlights that green building features, like improved indoor air quality and energy efficiency, contribute to increased property values and tenant satisfaction. Greenovation isn&#39;t just a passing trend; it&#39;s a transformative approach that recognises the interplay between human habitats and the natural world.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The synergy of innovation and sustainability is evident in the distinct projects undertaken by Shivalik.

While deciding to indulge in a luxurious living space is exciting, evaluating whether the property is truly worth its premium can be challenging.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Once the decision is made to invest in a luxury apartment, it is crucial to consider a few key factors:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Location, Location, Location</strong><br />\nThe foremost consideration when purchasing a luxury apartment is its location. The setting of the complex plays a pivotal role in determining accessibility to essential social infrastructure such as educational institutions, medical facilities, entertainment, and social avenues. Interacting with neighbours can provide insights into the sense of community. A well-chosen location is often reflected in the property&#39;s pricing.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Form, Function, Finish</strong><br />\nAttention to detail by the developer should be noticed in pursuing a luxury apartment. Beyond the visual appeal, ensuring that the property adheres to the National Building Code, particularly its resilience to natural disasters like earthquakes, is imperative. Quality luxury fittings, including climate control systems, solar panels, and rainwater harvesting systems, should match the financial investment. The construction techniques, material quality, and premium finishes reveal the true essence of luxury.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Technology</strong><br />\nLuxury apartments are designed to offer maximum comfort and cutting-edge facilities. Features such as landscaped gardens, spacious living areas, fully equipped kitchens, Wi-Fi, automated temperature control, and in-house gyms are common in upscale residential projects. Ensuring the chosen luxury apartment incorporates the latest technology and amenities is essential.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Security</strong><br />\nHigh-value luxury apartments often feature smart and technologically advanced security systems. Whether discreet security cameras, automated alarm systems, or access control systems for monitoring visitor entry, these measures ensure the home&#39;s and its residents&#39; safety.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Shivalik Group is a noteworthy option for those seeking a genuine luxury home in Ahmedabad.

Their commitment to integrating green building practices, innovative architectural designs, and strategic locations speaks volumes about their dedication to being a change for modern India.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This blog aims to publicize the ambitious vision of the Shivalik Group. Some key points behind <strong>Shivalik Group&rsquo;s Vision</strong> for the Future of Real Estate in India are as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Green Building and Sustainable Environments</strong></p>\n\n<p>At the heart of Shivalik Group&#39;s ethos is a commitment to green building practices. Understanding how critical sustainable development is, the Group blends eco-friendly designs and materials in its projects. This approach is about reducing the environmental footprint and creating healthier living spaces for residents. From energy-efficient lighting to water-saving fixtures and renewable materials, every aspect of a project is designed with sustainability.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Cost-Effective Living through Low Maintenance</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sustainability surpasses environmental benefits; Green buildings are inherently low-maintenance, translating into significant cost savings for residents. Green buildings are significantly lower than traditional structures, offering long-term financial benefits to homeowners.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Crafting a Better Skyline with Innovative Designs</strong></p>\n\n<p>Shivalik&#39;s projects are a testament to innovative architectural design in transforming city skylines. These buildings add to the urban landscape&#39;s aesthetic appeal and serve as icons and functional facilities. These projects showcase their dedication to creating exceptional designs that merge functionality with visual elegance.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Redefining GIFT City&#39;s Skyline with Shivalik Skyview and Shivalik Curv</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the quest to define the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT) skyline, Shivalik is working on two marquee projects: Shivalik Skyview and Shivalik Curv. These projects are thought to be landmarks of innovation with ultra-modern facilities. The Group aims to create architectural marvels that set new urban development standards. Other than these, Shivalik Highstreet and Shivalik Shilp are perfect examples of the Group&#39;s vision brought to life. They are premium commercial hubs symbolising profound working experience with architectural excellence and comfortable space.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Prime Locations for Discerning Customers</strong></p>\n\n<p>Location is paramount in real estate, and Shivalik meticulously chooses prime locales for their projects. Their properties are strategically situated in areas offering the best urban living &mdash; from essential services to leisure and entertainment options.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, Shivalik&rsquo;s vision for the future of real estate in India is a harmonious blend of sustainability, innovation, and community-focused development. They have established an ecosystem that provides a better standard of living, financial gains, and a feeling of community rather than merely buildings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5><span style=\"color:#7f8c8d;\">-&nbsp;Nidhi Raikundaliya</span></h5>\n","seo_title":"Shivalik Group’s Vision for the Future of Real Estate in India","seo_description":"Shivalik Group is an Indian real estate company that focuses on sustainable building practices, innovative architectural designs, and strategic locations.

With the interiors of Lofy by Shivalik Group in your home, you have the perfect canvas to create a stunning outdoor space. With a little creativity and some thoughtful planning, you can transform your balcony into a charming oasis that complements the modern aesthetic of your Lofy residence.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Choose the Right Furniture</strong></p>\n\n<p>The first step in balcony decoration is selecting the right furniture. Opt for comfortable and space-saving pieces like foldable chairs, a small table, or a cosy outdoor sofa. Consider weather-resistant materials like rattan, teak, or metal to ensure durability.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Add Greenery</strong></p>\n\n<p>Plants are the heart and soul of any outdoor space. Consider a mix of potted plants, hanging planters, and vertical gardens to infuse your balcony with lush greenery. Choose plants that thrive in your local climate and suit outdoor conditions.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create Ambiance with Lighting</strong></p>\n\n<p>A well-planned lighting scheme can transform your balcony into a magical retreat, especially in the evening. String lights, lanterns, and candles can add a warm and inviting glow. Solar-powered lights are an eco-friendly choice that requires minimal maintenance.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Incorporate Comfortable Textiles</strong></p>\n\n<p>Enhance the comfort of your balcony with plush cushions, throw pillows, and cosy blankets. Opt for fabrics that are designed for outdoor use, as they are weather-resistant and easy to clean.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Define Your Style</strong></p>\n\n<p>Consider the overall aesthetic of your Lofy apartment and extend it to your balcony. Whether you prefer a minimalist, bohemian, or contemporary look, choose decor and accessories that reflect your style.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Maximise Space with Multi-functional Furniture</strong></p>\n\n<p>If your balcony is smaller, make the most of the space with multi-functional furniture. Look for items that serve dual purposes, such as storage benches or tables with built-in planters.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create Privacy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Depending on your location, you might want to add privacy to your balcony. Use tall plants, bamboo screens, or outdoor curtains to create a secluded and intimate atmosphere.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Maintain a Clutter-Free Space</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lastly, keep your balcony tidy and organised. Avoid overcrowding the space with too much furniture or decor. A clutter-free environment will help you fully enjoy the beauty of your outdoor retreat.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, decorating your balcony is an opportunity to create a tranquil escape outside your door, with Lofy by Shivalik Group, you can create exclusive and functional designs.

But what&#39;s the secret behind its constant growth? Whether it&#39;s the house you call home or the towering skyscrapers in the city center, real estate isn&#39;t just bricks and mortar&ndash;it&#39;s a source of substantial wealth for many.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nFactors Fueling the Real Estate Boom</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Urbanization and Economic Expansion</strong></p>\n\n<p>The real estate boom in India owes its success to several key factors, including urbanization, technological advancements, economic growth, government initiatives, and evolving business trends. The real estate sector is experiencing high demand across residential, commercial, and retail segments, primarily due to increased investments in infrastructure, favorable policies, and rising income levels. This growth is closely linked to corporate demand and urbanization, which, in turn, creates economic opportunities and jobs.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Government Initiatives and Foreign Investments</strong></p>\n\n<p>Government initiatives like &quot;Make in India&quot; and foreign direct investments (FDI) have played a significant role in improving infrastructure and attracting foreign capital to the real estate sector, propelling its growth.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Technological Advancements</strong></p>\n\n<p>The digital transformation has revolutionized the real estate industry, increasing the demand for flexible and technologically advanced office spaces, particularly in the commercial real estate sector. Businesses now seek cutting-edge, tech-enabled office spaces, further boosting the real estate market.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Growth Projections</strong></p>\n\n<p>India&#39;s real estate market is set to achieve remarkable milestones. It&#39;s estimated to contribute around 13% to the country&#39;s GDP by 2025 and is on track to become a $1 trillion market by 2030. This rapid growth is driven by urbanization, rising incomes, increased investments, and a growing preference for secure and lucrative real estate investments, both in residential and commercial properties.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Demographics</strong></p>\n\n<p>Demographic factors such as age, gender, and income levels have a substantial impact on property prices and preferences. For example, the retirement of the baby boomer generation is driving the demand for second homes in picturesque locations, while smaller households due to children moving out are increasing the appeal of cozy cottages.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Interest Rates</strong></p>\n\n<p>Interest rates play a critical role in the real estate market. Low-interest rates make mortgages more affordable, attracting more buyers and pushing property prices higher. Conversely, high-interest rates can dampen demand, leading to a decrease in real estate values.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Economic Considerations</strong></p>\n\n<p>The overall economic health of a nation significantly influences real estate asset valuations. Economic indicators like GDP, employment data, manufacturing activity, and price levels have a direct impact on market activity.

Sustainable real estate investing entails purchasing homes that are energy-efficient, environmentally friendly, and compliant with morally and responsibly minded behaviour, rather than just focusing on financial gain. This article discusses sustainable real estate investing, highlighting its benefits and significance for investors.<br />\nEnvironmental Responsibility: Ecologically friendly methods are given top priority in sustainable real estate investing. This comprises eco-friendly materials, low-impact architectural designs, and energy-efficient structures. These characteristics lessen carbon footprints and promote a cleaner, more environmentally friendly world.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Financial Savings</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sustainable features frequently result in large financial savings.

Properties that are sustainable have an advantage over other properties in the market because they draw renters who care about the environment and are prepared to pay more for a cleaner place to live or work.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Resilience to Regulatory Changes</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sustainable homes are more likely to adhere to the increasingly stringent environmental rules enforced by governments across the globe, hence mitigating the danger of expensive retrofits and fines.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Long-Term Investment Value</strong></p>\n\n<p>As sustainable properties become increasingly in demand, their value tends to increase. They appeal to long-term investors because they provide stability against market swings and economic risks.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>A Wide Range of Investment Opportunities</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sustainable real estate includes residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. Because of this variety, investors can select the kind of real estate that best fits their objectives for sustainability.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Impact on Society and Ethics</strong></p>\n\n<p>Investing in sustainable real estate involves more than just the numbers. It enables investors to positively influence society and help create a more responsible and sustainable future.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />\nSustainable real estate investing is a forward-thinking strategy that balances ethical and environmental responsibility with financial success. Investors that prioritise sustainability stand to win financially as well as contribute to a future that is more robust and sustainable. By highlighting the advantages and significance of sustainable real estate investing, this article hopes to inspire readers to learn more about this expanding market and incorporate morally and environmentally sound decisions into their real estate holdings.

Beyond property ownership, an investor benefits from passive income in the form of rent, tax savings, relatively low volatility, capital appreciation, and portfolio diversification. Often, an investment requires thorough research and insights to make an informed and rational decision. In the case of real estate, with a wide variety of possibilities and market dynamics, it is important to consider which investment suits best, given all the internal and external socio-economic factors.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One may be a seasoned investor or a newcomer in the world of real estate, but the question of whether to invest in residential or commercial properties is always daunting for investors. Each type of property offers its own unique features and benefits that can offer a substantial return on investment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, owning a house is every individual&#39;s dream in their lifetime, making residential real estate a popular choice of investment. The cultural significance of owning a home also symbolizes financial stability and success. India&#39;s housing market has been consistently growing with the rise in urbanization and more people moving to cities. Sustained income and residential property investment are synonymous, as the perpetual need for shelter ensures a steady stream of rental income and consistent demand. The recent evolution and surge in average home rentals solidify residential properties as a promising avenue for investment. Additionally, residential properties are relatively less complex to navigate, making them more accessible for beginner investors and first-time buyers. Investment in residential properties always has twofold benefits for investors, as it serves the purpose of personal use alongside financial gain. Despite the multitude of factors, the real estate space has withstood the test of time and proven to be an ideal investment for medium and low-risk appetite investors.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, commercial properties have their own unique benefits with a close association with trade and economic growth. As cities grow, the need for trade, commerce, and businesses also grows. Commercial properties range from office and retail spaces to warehouses and industrial houses, creating the potential for investors to invest in niche markets and capitalize on specific market trends. While residential properties benefit from steady rental income, commercial properties benefit from higher rental yields, as businesses are willing to pay premium rents for prime locations. Moreover, commercial property investors enjoy stability for an extended period of time, with multi-year leases ensuring uninterrupted income. In the majority of commercial properties, the onus of maintenance falls on the tenant, reducing the financial responsibility of the owner. Commercial real estate has also demonstrated resilience amidst the global economic turmoil and is gradually picking up pace due to an ever-growing workforce and the need to accommodate decentralized growth corridors.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The choice between investing in residential or commercial property depends on an individual&#39;s goals and circumstances. An investor looking for a steady and predictable income with a more straightforward management experience may find it suitable to invest in residential properties. However, with a slightly higher risk appetite, the capability to bear upfront costs, and the ability to handle complex management, commercial properties could be the way to go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5><span style=\"color:#bdc3c7;\">- Sharvari Parikh</span></h5>\n","seo_title":"Real Estate Investments: Choosing Between Residential and Commercial Properties","seo_description":"Real estate investment offers long-term benefits like passive income, rent, tax savings, low volatility, capital appreciation, and portfolio diversification.

We will also briefly include snapshots of important judgements on redevelopment.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Reasons of Redevelopment.</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>To replace old and dilapidated buildings that are unsafe and unhealthy to live in;</li>\n\t<li>To increase the floor space index (FSI) and utilize the land potential more efficiently;</li>\n\t<li>To provide larger and better amenities to the residents, such as parking, fire safety, security, etc.;</li>\n\t<li>To enhance the aesthetic and environmental quality of the area;</li>\n\t<li>To generate revenue from the sale of surplus units or commercial spaces.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br />\n<strong>Redevelopment is done by:-</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The owners or members of the building or society themselves.</li>\n\t<li>The developers or builders who enter into an agreement with the owners or members.</li>\n\t<li>The public authorities, such as Gujarat Housing Board (GHB), Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), Urban Development Authorities (UDAs), etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Legal guidelines for redevelopment in Gujarat.</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The redevelopment has to be done with the consent of not less than seventy-five per cent of the members of the society.</li>\n\t<li>The redevelopment has to be done after twenty-five years of the issuance of the permission for development or if the building is declared dilapidated, ruinous or dangerous by the concerned authority.</li>\n\t<li>The redevelopment has to be done by a registered developer or builder who has experience in redevelopment projects.</li>\n\t<li>The redevelopment has to be done as per the Common GDCR, Redevelopment Rules, Affordable Housing Policy, etc.</li>\n\t<li>The redevelopment has to be done with all the necessary clearances and permissions from various authorities, such as GHB, ULBs, UDAs, RERA, fire department, environment department, etc.</li>\n\t<li>The redevelopment has to be done with safety norms and environmental standards.</li>\n\t<li>The redevelopment has to be done with transparency and accountability.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Process of Redevelopment</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Initiation:</strong> The redevelopment can be initiated by the managing committee of the society suo-moto or by an application from at least one-fourth of the members of the flats. The managing committee has to call for a special general meeting within a period of one month on receipt of the application. The meeting has to follow the rules and bylaws of the society with respect to convening, notice, agenda, quorum, decision, agreement, minutes, etc.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Consent: </strong>The consent of not less than seventy-five per cent of the total members of the society for redevelopment is necessary. The consent has to be obtained in writing.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Developer selection:</strong> The managing committee along with the society members has to select a developer for construction of the project. The proposals of redevelopment received from various developers shall be evaluated based on various parameters, such as financial capability, technical expertise, quality standards, track record, etc. However, the society shall give more priority to the experience and project completion capacity of the builder over other things. The selection can be from the internal references or through a tender bidding process.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Registered Development Agreement: </strong>The society has to select the best developer or builder and enter into a registered development agreement with him.

The demolition has to be done in a safe and scientific manner without causing any damage or inconvenience to the neighboring properties or people.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Construction:</strong> The developer or builder has to construct the new building or society as per the approved layout plan and design within the stipulated time frame. The construction has to be done with quality materials and workmanship under the supervision of the architect or project management consultant.

The developer or builder has to also hand over all the documents and records related to the redevelopment project to the managing committee.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Benefits of Redevelopment</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<h3><strong>Infrastructure Upgrade:</strong> Redevelopment projects provide an opportunity to upgrade and modernize infrastructure, including roads, drainage systems, and utilities, enhancing overall living conditions.</h3>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<h3><strong>Increased Housing Stock:</strong> Redevelopment optimizes land use by replacing old structures with modern, multi-story buildings, thereby increasing the available housing stock.</h3>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<h3><strong>Enhanced Aesthetics:</strong> The introduction of contemporary architectural designs and landscaping improves the visual appeal of the area, contributing to the overall urban aesthetics.</h3>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<h3><strong>Improved Amenities:</strong> Redevelopment projects often incorporate amenities such as green spaces, recreational facilities, and commercial spaces, enhancing the quality of life for residents.</h3>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<h3><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> The real estate and construction industries experience growth through increased demand for skilled labor, building materials, and related services, fostering economic development.</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Some important Judgements in relation to Redevelopment</strong></h3>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hansaben Ratubhai Prajapati v. State of Gujarat. &nbsp;</strong><br />\n(Gujarat High Court decided on 11-04-2023)</p>\n\n<p><br />\nWhen a redevelopment scheme is in the interest of public at large, the entire project cannot be put to a standstill at the behest of few persons (14 petitioners) when 75% of the occupants have consented to the redevelopment.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Adityaraj Builders v. State of Maharashtra.</strong><br />\n(Bombay High Court decided on 17-02-2023.)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A development agreement (DA) between a cooperative housing society and a developer for developing society&rsquo;s property (land, building, apartments, flats, garages, godowns, galas) requires to be stamped.</li>\n\t<li>The development agreement need not be signed by individual members of society as a mandate. Even if individual members do not sign the DA, it controls the re-development and society members&rsquo; rights.</li>\n\t<li>A Permanent Alternate Accommodation Agreements (PAAA) between developer and an individual society member does not require to be signed on behalf of the society.</li>\n\t<li>Stamp cannot be levied twice. Once the DA is stamped, the PAAA cannot be separately assessed to stamp beyond the requirement of Rs. 100 under Section 4(1), if it specifically relates to rebuilt or reconstructed premises in lieu of the old premises used/occupied by the member. The same applies even if the PAAA includes an additional area available to the member, since it is not a purchase or a transfer but is in lieu of the member&rsquo;s old premises. The stamp on DA includes reconstruction of every unit in the society building.</li>\n\t<li>If PAAA is limited to rebuilt premises in the absence of actual purchase for consideration of any additional area, such PAAA is an incidental document under Section 4(1) of the Stamp Act.</li>\n\t<li>PAAA between a developer and a society member must be additionally stamped if it provides for purchase for actual stated consideration and a purchase price of additional area beyond the area given to the member against the earlier premises.</li>\n\t<li>Assessing stamp on PAAA on construction cost of the new premises in lieu of old premises cannot be sustained.</li>\n\t<li>Reference to redevelopment and homes includes garages, galas, commercial and industrial use and every form of redevelopment of the society.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Redevelopment is a complex and challenging process that requires careful planning and execution. It involves various stakeholders, such as members, managing committee, developer, builder, architect, consultant, authorities, etc. It also involves various risks, such as legal disputes, financial losses, delays, defects, etc. Therefore, it is advisable to seek professional guidance and assistance from experts in the field of redevelopment.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Redevelopment is a powerful tool for revitalizing urban spaces in Gujarat, catering to the growing demands of modern living while simultaneously enhancing the aesthetic and economic aspects of the region. By adhering to the established legal guidelines and fostering cooperation between stakeholders, successful redevelopment projects can contribute significantly to the state&#39;s urban development narrative. As Gujarat progresses towards a more vibrant urban future, redevelopment stands as a testament to innovation, sustainable growth, and community development.</p>\n","seo_title":"Redevelopment of a Real Estate Project in Gujarat","seo_description":"Redevelopment of real estate projects has become a vital aspect of urban development, especially in densely populated areas where land is scarce.

You sink into your plush sofa, taking in the spaciousness, the clutter-free surfaces, and the clever storage solutions that have turned your once-cramped flat into a serene retreat.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Gone are the days of feeling suffocated by clutter or navigating around oversized furniture. With these fantastic ideas, your 4 BHK flat will soon feel expansive, organized, and simply magnificent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Leverage the Magic of Mirrors</strong></p>\n\n<p>Mirrors create an illusion of more space by reflecting light and providing depth. Strategically place mirrors on walls, shelves, or as part of your furniture, such as a mirrored coffee table or dresser.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Illuminate Wisely</strong></p>\n\n<p>Adequate lighting can make a difference in making your 4 BHK residential flat feel open and inviting. Let the natural light flood in by keeping drapes and blinds open during the day. Use ceiling, floor, and table lamps to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Choose Furniture Thoughtfully</strong></p>\n\n<p>Opt for furniture that maximizes space. Avoid bulky pieces and instead select multi-functional and space-saving options. A storage ottoman can double as both a footrest and a place to stow blankets and pillows, while a sofa bed can provide extra sleeping space for guests.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Embrace Lighter Colors</strong></p>\n\n<p>The choice of colors for your walls and furnishings can significantly impact the perception of space. Lighter shades like white, cream, and beige create an illusion of a larger, more open area, while darker colors can make a room feel confined. Opt for brighter colors on your walls, curtains, and furniture upholstery.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Keep Surfaces Clutter-Free</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of the easiest ways to make your 4 BHK residential flat in Ahmedabad feel more spacious is by maintaining clutter-free surfaces. Instead of crowding tables and shelves with numerous decorative items, choose a few carefully selected pieces that enhance the overall ambiance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Define Zones</strong></p>\n\n<p>Create distinct zones within your four-bedroom flat using rugs, furniture placement, and lighting. Whether it&#39;s a reading nook, dining area, or workspace, these defined areas can help you make the most of your space and foster a sense of coziness.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Utilize Vertical Space</strong></p>\n\n<p>Maximizing vertical space becomes crucial when floor space is limited. Install shelves, bookcases, and wall-mounted storage to organize your belongings and free up valuable floor space.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Innovative Storage Solutions</strong></p>\n\n<p>Get creative with storage options such as built-in shelving, under-bed storage, and storage ottomans. These unique solutions will help you make the most of your space and keep it clutter-free.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Bonus Idea by Lofy:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Consider investing in furniture with dual functions to maximize space efficiently. A sofa bed serves as both a comfortable seating area during the day and a cozy bed for guests at night, while a storage ottoman can provide a place to relax and store blankets, pillows, and more.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#bdc3c7;\">-&nbsp;Jayshree Ochwani</span></h5>\n","seo_title":"Make your 4 BHK flat more spacious","seo_description":"To create a serene retreat in a 4 BHK flat, use mirrors, adequate lighting, furniture that maximizes space, and clutter-free surfaces.

However, deciding whether to buy or rent is a big choice that impacts your aspirations, lifestyle, and financial stability. Whichever choice you select, it will all depend on your financial and lifestyle circumstances. Both may need some work to maintain and a consistent source of income (so you can pay the bills and related expenses).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The decision to buy a house or rent one can depend on a variety of factors, such as your financial situation, lifestyle, and future plans. In general, buying a house can be a good investment in the long run, as property values tend to appreciate over time.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Buying a property comes with the advantages of building your own equity and passing it over to the next generations as an asset. This pattern has been in practice for a very long period of time and has been proven to be a profitable move. Investing in a property not only means putting your foot down practically and financially but it also brings along a sense of community building, stability, and security to your near and dear ones. In your own space, you are at will to remodel/ re-shape according to your personal needs without any hassle of permissions and dependency on the landlord in the case of rented properties.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Renting on the other hand is preferred by people who are always on their toes and might require to relocate every now and then. Renting is considered as a temporary housing option as it does not build any long-term equity or asset. However, these rented properties prove to be an additional source of income for the owner. Rented properties do not provide tax-saving benefits which in turn is a loss to the occupant. The market trends for renting have no specifics or insights to study which gives the owner the power to manipulate the occupant for a higher rent. There is also a significant risk of sudden eviction to the occupant as the landlord might always look for higher rental income irrespective of the occupant&rsquo;s conditions.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\nShivalik Group also encourages the general public to opt for buying instead of renting real estate property by promoting customer-friendly payment schemes wherein the buyer can easily analyse the difference between EMI cost and rental cost and is easier on the customer&rsquo;s pocket.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4><span style=\"color:#7f8c8d;\">- Dhruv Jain</span></h4>\n","seo_title":"Buying vs. Renting Real Estate","seo_description":"Owning a home is a dream, but the decision depends on personal financial circumstances and future plans.

The Indian real estate sector has shown resilience and growth in the past few years, despite the global economic slowdown and the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a report by 360 Realtors, NRIs invested $13.1 billion in the Indian real estate market in FY21 and the inflow is likely to grow 12% to reach $14.9 billion in FY22 &amp; FY23.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>There are many factors that make real estate investment attractive for NRIs, such as</strong></p>\n\n<p>Favorable currency exchange rate: The depreciation of the Indian rupee against major foreign currencies like the US dollar, the Euro, and the Singapore dollar gives NRIs a higher purchasing power and a better return on investment.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Demand for luxury homes</strong></p>\n\n<p>NRIs often look for spacious and comfortable homes that suit their lifestyle and offer amenities like security, clubhouse, gym, pool, etc. The demand for luxury homes in India has increased in recent years, especially in cities like Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad, and Chennai. These cities also offer high rental yields and capital appreciation for luxury properties.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ease of buying process</strong></p>\n\n<p>The government has simplified the rules and regulations for NRI investment in real estate in India. NRIs do not need any prior permission from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) or any other authority to buy residential or commercial properties in India. They can also avail of home loans from Indian banks and financial institutions at attractive interest rates.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Emotional and sentimental value</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many NRIs have an emotional attachment to their homeland and want to own property in their native place. Buying a home in India also gives them a sense of security and belongingness. They can also use their property as a vacation home or a retirement home when they visit India or settle down here.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>However, before investing in real estate in India, NRIs should also be aware of some challenges and risks, such as</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tax implications</strong></p>\n\n<p>NRIs have to pay taxes on their income from real estate in India, such as rental income, capital gains, and wealth tax. They also have to comply with the tax laws of their country of residence and avoid double taxation by claiming tax benefits under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) between India and their country.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Legal issues</strong></p>\n\n<p>NRIs should verify the legal status and ownership of the property they are buying and ensure that it has all the necessary approvals and clearances from the authorities.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Maintenance and management</strong></p>\n\n<p>NRIs should also consider how they will maintain and manage their property in India when they are not physically present here.

Each floor offers a unique living experience, with a delicate balance of advantages and considerations. The first floor, easily accessible and reassuringly close to the entrance, may suit those valuing convenience and security. On the second floor, residents find a middle ground of accessibility and tranquillity. The upper floors have breathtaking views, reduced noise, ample natural light, and enhanced ventilation. Customers must carefully weigh these factors, as well as any pricing differences, to select the floor that harmonizes best with their lifestyle, needs, and personal preferences. The floor choice ultimately shapes not just their physical living space but also their overall living experience in the building.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nHere&rsquo;s a floor-wise description of the advantages and considerations when booking a flat in a multi-story building:</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>First Floor:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Accessibility: The first floor is the most accessible and convenient for those with elders and small children. It is very advantageous for those who want easy access without relying on elevators, which can also be helpful for individuals with mobility issues.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Safety</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some customers may feel more secure on the first floor as it is closer to the building&#39;s entrance.<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Second &amp; Third Floor</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Middle ground</strong></p>\n\n<p>Easily reachable by stairs and elevator, making it convenient for most residents.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Balanced Noise</strong></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s often quieter than the first floor but still provides easy access.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nIt strikes a balance between being higher up and not too far from the ground. This can be ideal for those who want some of the benefits of elevation without being extremely high up. While it may require the use of an elevator or a short climb of stairs, it&#39;s usually more accessible than the uppermost floors, making it a practical choice for many residents, including those with mobility concerns.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Upper Floors (Fourth and Above)</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Views</strong></p>\n\n<p>Higher floors typically offer better views.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Less Noise</strong></p>\n\n<p>Upper floors tend to be quieter, away from street-level noises.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>More Natural Light</strong></p>\n\n<p>Increased sunlight due to height, provides a brighter living space.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Ventilation</strong></p>\n\n<p>Better air circulation on higher floors can enhance comfort.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Security</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some residents feel more secure on upper floors, as they are less accessible.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Considerations for Upper Floors</strong></p>\n\n<p>Elevator Dependency: You may need to rely on elevators for access, which could be a consideration during peak usage times.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nHence, lower floors, easily accessible and reassuringly may suit those valuing convenience and security. However, it&#39;s the upper floors that often steal the spotlight with breathtaking views, and reduced noise.</p>\n\n<h4><br />\n<br />\nIt&#39;s a decision that should be made thoughtfully, considering family preferences, priorities, and budget constraints, as it plays an influential role in defining one&#39;s daily life and comfort within the building.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#bdc3c7;\">-&nbsp;Hardi Shah</span></h4>\n","seo_title":"Decoding the Perks of Each Floor: From Ground to Skyline","seo_description":"A floor guide line at Skyline.

If you have, then you have witnessed a twisted commercial building, a new trend in architecture that is gaining popularity around the world.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nA twisted commercial building is a building that has a curved or twisted shape, rather than a straight or rectangular one. This design creates a dynamic and eye-catching appearance, as well as some practical and environmental benefits.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nIn this blog, we will explore what makes a twisted commercial building so unique and attractive, and how it can enhance the value and performance of a commercial space.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWe will also introduce you to Shivalik Curv, India&rsquo;s twisted tower, and how it is setting a new benchmark in architectural excellence and innovation.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>What is a Twisted Commercial Building?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A twisted commercial building is a building that has a non-linear shape, meaning that it does not follow a straight line or a right angle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nInstead, it has a curved or twisted form, creating an impression of movement and dynamism. A twisted commercial building can have different degrees of twist, from subtle to dramatic, depending on the design and the purpose of the building.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nA twisted commercial building can be achieved by various methods, such as using different materials, angles, or structural systems. Some common techniques are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Using different floor plates or modules that rotate or shift along the height of the building</li>\n\t<li>Using diagonal columns or beams that support the twisting shape of the building</li>\n\t<li>Using curved glass panels or facades that create an illusion of twist</li>\n\t<li>Using prefabricated or modular units that can be assembled in different configurations<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Why Choose a Twisted Commercial Building?</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nA twisted commercial building is not just a visual spectacle, but also a smart choice for many reasons. Some of the advantages of choosing a twisted commercial building are:</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nAesthetic appeal: A twisted commercial building stands out from the crowd and creates a memorable impression on the viewers. It also reflects the creativity and vision of the architect and the owner of the building.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nFunctional efficiency: A twisted commercial building can optimize the use of space and light, as well as reduce wind loads and vibrations. By rotating or shifting the floor plates or modules, a twisted commercial building can create more floor area, more views, more natural light, and more ventilation for the occupants. By curving or twisting the shape of the building, a twisted commercial building can also reduce the impact of wind forces and seismic movements on the structure.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nEnvironmental sustainability: A twisted commercial building can also contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions. By maximizing natural light and ventilation, a twisted commercial building can lower the need for artificial lighting and cooling systems. By minimizing wind loads and vibrations, a twisted commercial building can also reduce the amount of material and reinforcement needed for the construction.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Examples of Twisted Commercial Buildings Around the World</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nTwisted commercial buildings are not a new phenomenon, but they have become more popular and prevalent in recent years.

Imagine stepping into your dream space before it&#39;s even constructed. Thanks to the wonders of 3D visualization, your dreams can now become a reality. In this blog, we&#39;ll explore the importance of 3D visualization and how it can revolutionize the way you plan and design your home.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nVisualizing the Unseen:<br />\nOne of the most significant benefits of 3D visualization is its ability to bring your interior design concepts to life. Before 3D visualization, homeowners relied on blueprints and sketches to understand what their future homes might look like. However, with 3D visualization, you can explore every corner of your home in vivid detail. It&#39;s like taking a virtual tour of your home-to-be, long before construction begins.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nEliminating Surprises:<br />\nSurprises are rarely welcome in home design and construction. 3D visualization helps eliminate these surprises by allowing you to see the final look of your home in advance. You can make changes and adjustments to the design until it matches your vision. This means no unexpected layout issues or design regrets.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nInformed Decision-Making:<br />\n3D visualization allows you to make informed decisions about your interior design. You can experiment with different colour schemes, furniture arrangements, and finishes. It&#39;s like having a paintbrush and palette to create your masterpiece. You can see how your choices impact the overall look of your home, helping you create a space that genuinely reflects your style and personality.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nSaving Time and Money:<br />\nOne of the most practical aspects of 3D visualization is its ability to save you time and money. By identifying potential design flaws or issues early on, you can avoid costly changes during construction. This results in fewer delays, fewer budget overruns, and a smoother building process.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nEffective Communication:<br />\n3D visualization acts as a universal language that bridges the communication gap between you and the professionals working on your project. It ensures that everyone understands your vision, facilitating effective collaboration and a successful outcome.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nA Sense of Anticipation:<br />\nAnother exciting aspect of 3D visualization is that it adds an element of anticipation to the home-building process. You can get a glimpse of your future home and build excitement for the day you move in. It&#39;s like opening a present before the big day arrives.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nIn Closing!<br />\n3D visualization is a game-changer in the world of interior design and home construction. It provides a clear, detailed, and immersive way to see how your home will appear in the future. It eliminates surprises, saves time and money, and enhances effective communication throughout the design and construction process.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nSo, if you&#39;re planning to build your dream home, make sure to consider the advantages of 3D visualization. It&#39;s the key to bringing your dreams to life, one pixel at a time. Get ready to step into your dream space and watch your home transform from imagination to reality!<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#999999;\">-<span style=\"background-color:#000000;\">Jayshree Ochwani</span></span></p>\n","seo_title":"The Significance of 3D Visualization in Interior Design","seo_description":"3D visualization in interior design is very important.

Taking this first step allows you to secure your dream home without making a large upfront payment.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. 75% Loan with EMI after Possession</strong><br />\n75% of the total amount is covered by a loan, with EMI payments beginning after possession. In this way, you don&#39;t have to worry about EMI payments until you move into your new home.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. 15% Due Upon Possession</strong><br />\nYou will pay 15% upon taking possession of your new home. Taking this phased approach to payments ensures a smooth and stress-free buying experience, allowing you to settle in easily.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What Are the Benefits of This Payment Plan?</strong><br />\nA key feature of the 10:75:15 plan is that there are no interest or home loans until possession.</p>\n\n<p>Consider this scenario - with a traditional home loan at 9% interest for Rs. 1 crore over 30 years, you would pay Rs. 9.65 lacs in interest every year. In the 10:75:15 plan, you&#39;ll have no interest payments or home loan obligations until you take possession of your new home.</p>\n\n<p>In practical terms, this means substantial savings. Depending on the possession timeline, you could easily save Rs. 20-30 lacs by avoiding interest payments during the pre-possession period.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Also, those who live in rented houses benefit from this plan since EMIs don&#39;t start until they get possession, so they don&#39;t have to worry about managing both.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nShivalik Group is planning to extend the same transparent and hassle-free payment plan to its upcoming projects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Get in touch with Shivalik Group to learn more about this innovative payment plan and to find your dream home.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>- Kishan Thakkar</p>\n","seo_title":"How Does Shivalik Group’s Payment Plan 10:75:15 Benefit Homebuyers?","seo_description":"Learn about Shivalik Group's payment plan 10:75:15 and its advantages for homebuyers in this article.

However, securing financing for land investment can be a complex process, requiring careful planning and consideration.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nSmart investors understand the nuances of land financing and leverage a variety of strategies to secure the best possible terms and conditions. Here is a sophisticated guide to financing a land investment:</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Evaluate Your Investment Goals and Risk Tolerance</strong><br />\n<br />\nBefore exploring financing options, it is essential to have a clear understanding of your investment goals and risk tolerance. What is your intended use for the land? Are you looking to develop the land, hold it for appreciation, or both? Once you have a clear understanding of your goals, you can assess your risk tolerance and determine how much leverage you are comfortable with.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Explore Traditional and Non-Traditional Financing Options</strong><br />\n<br />\nTraditional lenders, such as banks and credit unions, offer a variety of loan products for land purchases. However, they may have strict credit score and debt-to-income ratio requirements. Sophisticated investors often explore non-traditional financing options, such as private lenders, hard money loans, and crowdfunding platforms. These options may be more flexible, but they may also come with higher interest rates and shorter repayment terms.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Structure Your Financing to Optimize Tax Benefits</strong><br />\n<br />\nLand investment can offer several tax benefits, such as capital gains tax deductions and depreciation deductions. Sophisticated investors carefully structure their financing to maximize these tax benefits. For example, they may use debt financing to purchase the land and equity financing to finance development costs. This can help to reduce their taxable income and increase their overall returns.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Mitigate Risk with Diversification</strong><br />\n<br />\nWise investors understand the importance of diversification. This means spreading your investment across different asset classes and sectors to reduce your overall risk. When financing a land investment, you can mitigate risk by diversifying your funding sources and investing in a variety of land parcels.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Work with Experienced Professionals</strong><br />\n<br />\nLand investment can be a complex undertaking, and it is important to work with experienced professionals throughout the process. This includes financial advisors, attorneys, and real estate professionals. Experienced professionals can help you assess your investment goals, explore financing options, and structure your transaction to optimize your returns and mitigate risk.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>By following these well-thought-out strategies, you can increase your chances of success when financing a land investment. Remember, always seek professional financial advice before making any significant investment decisions.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n-&nbsp;Khushbu Raval</p>\n","seo_title":"","seo_description":"","seo_keywords":"","seo_image":"","seo_image_full":"","tags":[{"text":"Land","tag_lower":"land"},{"text":"Real Estate","tag_lower":"real estate"},{"text":"Shivalik","tag_lower":"shivalik"},{"text":"Investment","tag_lower":"investment"}],"tags_array":["Land","Real Estate","Shivalik","Investment"],"tags_commaseparted":"Land,Real Estate,Shivalik,Investment","published_time":1698258600,"published_date":"26 Oct, 2023","created_at_time":1698336051,"date_format":"","date_time":"09:30 PM","created_at_show":{"created_at":"26 Oct, 2023","created_at_time":"09:30 PM"},"updated_at":"Oct 27, 2023","updated_at_time":1698405961,"is_active":1,"master_user_id":"1","master_user_id_add":"","is_notify_to_user":"1","is_deleted_request":"0","is_approved":"1","approved_date":"","email_subject":"","email_body":"","added_by":"shivalik group","added_by_type":"admin"},{"share_url":{"website_url":"https://www.shivalikgroup.com/articles/how-shivalik-group-has-changed-the-skyline-of-ahmedabad"},"id":213,"project_id":"","page_id":"","joint_page_id":"","slug":"how-shivalik-group-has-changed-the-skyline-of-ahmedabad","image":"banner_1698247228_54.jpg","image_full":"https://www.reecosys.com/api/image-tool/index.php?src=https://www.reecosys.com/assets/uploads/blog/banner/banner_1698247228_54.jpg","banner_title":"How Shivalik Group Has Changed the Skyline of Ahmedabad","title":"How Shivalik Group Has Changed the Skyline of Ahmedabad","description":"<p>Ahmedabad has experienced rapid development over the past few decades, with skyscrapers, malls, and other urban developments built all over the city.

As the holiday season approaches, historically a period of heightened real estate activity, it&#39;s essential to delve deeper into what the market holds in store. Let&#39;s explore the fascinating world of real estate as we gear up for the holiday season, from emerging trends to innovative strategies.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nIn India, the festive season signifies more than just celebration; it&#39;s a time of increased vibrancy and potential in the real estate market, making it an ideal time for investment. Festivals like Navratras, Dussehra, Dhanteras, and Diwali, symbolizing fresh beginnings and prosperity, typically witness a substantial surge in housing purchases. Market participants seize this opportunity to create an inviting atmosphere, often offering enticing discounts and significant incentives, thereby invigorating the real estate industry.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nThis annual peak in business activity includes a slew of new projects and a range of incentives designed to attract homebuyers. During this season, the heightened demand for homes often translates into actual purchases, as prospective buyers are more likely to turn their dreams into reality, emphasizing stability and security, further fueling the demand for residential properties.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nDespite current home loan interest rates, demand for housing continues to show surprising resilience due to the affordability of the market. Homebuyers are not merely interested; they are enthusiastic about finalizing their real estate purchases during this auspicious season, underscoring the shift towards committed buyers.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nAccording to recent estimates, the housing real estate sector experienced a substantial upswing during FYQ3 2022, with 88,230 dwelling units sold in the top seven cities&mdash;a remarkable 4% increase from the previous quarter and an impressive 41% increase from 2021. These figures indicate a 20% rise in sales during Q3, which corresponds to the holiday season in 2023. What sets today&#39;s housing demand apart is that even millennials view real estate as the most desirable asset class. The industry is balanced for a promising future, buoyed by improved consumer confidence and a thriving market. This expansion aligns with the growth of the corporate landscape and the increasing demand for enhanced lifestyles and housing options. The property market currently enjoys increased home purchasing activity, driven by end-user preferences and supported by higher savings and market stability.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nHomeownership offers tax benefits, including deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes, making it a prudent financial decision. Early-year government initiatives will further encourage millennials to invest in real estate, making homeownership more accessible during this holiday season. Year-end bonuses or cash gifts add to the allure, making homeownership an attractive option for millennials interested in real estate investing.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nIn conclusion, the resurgence of market enthusiasm amid a backdrop of robust economic activity makes the holiday season an opportunity for real estate investment. The revival of the real estate industry signals economic recovery and prosperity. With cautious optimism, this holiday season has the potential to provide a much-needed boost to the real estate sector.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>-Jayshree Ochwani</p>\n","seo_title":"","seo_description":"","seo_keywords":"","seo_image":"","seo_image_full":"","tags":[{"text":"Festival","tag_lower":"festival"},{"text":"Real Estate","tag_lower":"real estate"},{"text":"Shivalik","tag_lower":"shivalik"},{"text":"Holiday","tag_lower":"holiday"}],"tags_array":["Festival","Real Estate","Shivalik","Holiday"],"tags_commaseparted":"Festival,Real Estate,Shivalik,Holiday","published_time":1698172200,"published_date":"25 Oct, 2023","created_at_time":1698210217,"date_format":"","date_time":"10:33 AM","created_at_show":{"created_at":"25 Oct, 2023","created_at_time":"10:33 AM"},"updated_at":"Oct 25, 2023","updated_at_time":1698215572,"is_active":1,"master_user_id":"1","master_user_id_add":"","is_notify_to_user":"1","is_deleted_request":"0","is_approved":"1","approved_date":"","email_subject":"","email_body":"","added_by":"shivalik group","added_by_type":"admin"},{"share_url":{"website_url":"https://www.shivalikgroup.com/articles/navratri-property-deals:-the-best-time-to-buy-and-sell-real-estate"},"id":210,"project_id":"","page_id":"","joint_page_id":"","slug":"navratri-property-deals:-the-best-time-to-buy-and-sell-real-estate","image":"banner_1698045888_7.jpg","image_full":"https://www.reecosys.com/api/image-tool/index.php?src=https://www.reecosys.com/assets/uploads/blog/banner/banner_1698045888_7.jpg","banner_title":"Navratri : The Best Time to Buy and Sell Real Estate","title":"Navratri Property Deals: The Best Time to Buy and Sell Real Estate","description":"<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\n\n<p>In India, the nine-night festival of Navratri, which is observed with great zeal and devotion, has great cultural significance. Navratri offers a special window of opportunity for people interested in real estate transactions, in addition to traditional dancing and prayer. The tenth day of Navratri, Dussehra, falls during this month, which is particularly auspicious for real estate transactions. Here&#39;s why the greatest time to buy real estate is around Navratri, which culminates in a big celebration on Dussehra.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Auspicious Beginnings</strong><br />\nNavratri signifies fresh starts, and buying a new home is the ideal way to make a fresh start. It&#39;s a fortunate moment for homebuyers to start a new chapter with a new residence. For sellers, it&#39;s a chance to start over by finalising a transaction and advancing financially.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Festival of Prosperity</strong><br />\nNavratri is all about celebrating prosperity and abundance. This theme resonates perfectly with real estate investments, which are seen as long-term wealth-building assets.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Spiritual Significance of Dussehra</strong><br />\nThe last day of Navratri, Dussehra, represents the victory of good over evil. It might be viewed as an opportunity for real estate buyers to overcome uncertainty by selecting a prudent investment. Sellers may see it as a chance to start over by getting rid of negative energy and stagnant real estate.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Community and Neighbourhood&nbsp;Vibrancy</strong><br />\nNavratri brings communities together in celebration. It&#39;s an opportunity for buyers to experience the vibrancy of neighbourhoods and envision themselves as part of the community, which can be a significant factor in property selection.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nThe happy celebration of Dussehra, which follows Navratri, provides a great setting for real estate purchases. Property deals are made more special by the combination of spiritual importance, joyful celebration, and auspicious beginnings.

Real estate presents investors with a concrete and possibly profitable opportunity, as opposed to the erratic nature of stocks or the uncertainty of other investment possibilities.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tangible Asset with Intrinsic Value</strong></p>\n\n<p>Real estate&#39;s tangibility is one of the main reasons it stands out as a top investment option. You purchase a material object with inherent worth when you invest in real estate. Buildings and land have intrinsic value that frequently increases over time. Many other investments cannot compare to the sense of security that this concrete nature offers.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Consistent Income Stream</strong></p>\n\n<p>Real estate investing, especially in rental homes, can offer a steady and dependable revenue source. Rental income delivers a consistent revenue flow that may be utilised to pay costs, reinvest, or save for future goals, unlike other investments where you must rely on market volatility.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Diversification of Investment Portfolio</strong></p>\n\n<p>Real estate is a fantastic means of achieving diversification, which is a fundamental component of successful investing. When other investments in your portfolio are more volatile, adding real estate assets can help distribute risk and offer stability.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tax Benefits</strong></p>\n\n<p>Real estate investing has several tax benefits. Taxes on real estate, mortgage interest, and some maintenance costs may all be deducted. Real estate investment is also frequently encouraged by the government through tax advantages, making it an even more alluring choice.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Legacy and Generational Wealth</strong></p>\n\n<p>You may leave your family a lasting legacy by investing in real estate. Future generations can get properties from you, giving them a priceless asset that can safeguard their financial future.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Control and Customization</strong></p>\n\n<p>Real estate gives you direct control over your investment, in contrast to several other investments over which you have only limited authority. To raise the value and rental revenue of your home, you might manage, renovate, or update it.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nThe bottom line is that real estate investing is a tried-and-true method for accumulating money, establishing financial security, and ensuring a happy future. Real estate offers a route to financial success that can&#39;t be overlooked, whether you&#39;re an experienced investor or just getting started. To gain from the many advantages real estate has to offer, think about making a wise choice and including it in your investment portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>-Bhavya Shah</p>\n","seo_title":"","seo_description":"","seo_keywords":"","seo_image":"","seo_image_full":"","tags":[{"text":"Real Estate","tag_lower":"real estate"},{"text":"Investment","tag_lower":"investment"}],"tags_array":["Real Estate","Investment"],"tags_commaseparted":"Real Estate,Investment","published_time":1697221800,"published_date":"14 Oct, 2023","created_at_time":1697289317,"date_format":"","date_time":"06:45 PM","created_at_show":{"created_at":"14 Oct, 2023","created_at_time":"06:45 PM"},"updated_at":"Oct 16, 2023","updated_at_time":1697438522,"is_active":1,"master_user_id":"1","master_user_id_add":"","is_notify_to_user":"1","is_deleted_request":"0","is_approved":"1","approved_date":"","email_subject":"","email_body":"","added_by":"shivalik group","added_by_type":"admin"},{"share_url":{"website_url":"https://www.shivalikgroup.com/articles/the-role-of-technology-in-real-estate-investment"},"id":203,"project_id":"","page_id":"","joint_page_id":"","slug":"the-role-of-technology-in-real-estate-investment","image":"banner_1697204755_3.jpg","image_full":"https://www.reecosys.com/api/image-tool/index.php?src=https://www.reecosys.com/assets/uploads/blog/banner/banner_1697204755_3.jpg","banner_title":"The Role of Technology in Real Estate Investment","title":"The Role of Technology in Real Estate Investment","description":"<p>The combination of technology and real estate investing is not just a fad; it is a powerful force that is changing the landscape of the sector.

There are many factors contributing to this success story where the purchase affordability of property remains on top as the capital value for the land remains significantly lower than the other fast-developing states.</p>\n\n<p>According to some studies, the real estate sector is likely to touch a cap of $1 trillion by 2030. The sector is likely to produce 100 million jobs by the end of the decade with the share of skilled workforce expected to rise from 9.7% in 2023 to 10.5% by 2030. This growth is expected to arise from all domains of the construction sector like- real estate, infrastructure development, affordable housing, commercial assets, etc. The commercial market sector has surged a substantial 33.3% from the previous quarter. Gujarat has emerged as a dark horse in the race of the hot real estate market where metro cities like Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, etc. are some other key players.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nWidely recognised market researchers&#39; study states that Ahmedabad was the most affordable housing market in India in 2022 with an affordability ratio of 22%. (Affordability ratio is calculated by dividing house prices by gross annual workplace-based earnings.) The city enjoys excellent connectivity to the rest of the state and the addition of new town-planning schemes being developed hand-in-hand with the population demand are boosting a vibrant residential and commercial real estate in the city.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nAhmedabad, being the Twin-city of Gandhinagar is also set to see growth momentum with the development of GIFT city. Some 55 lakh square feet of residential real estate space is coming up on the campus with an investment of 2700 crores over the next five years. With the provision of premium infrastructure, the average prices of housing are on the higher end. The positivity in the market is driven by the fact that people are upgrading their lifestyles, so residential real estate will gain good momentum.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Investing in real estate in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar (as Twin-cities) is a lucrative opportunity given the range of residential properties that can provide attractive ROI. The Shivalik group has been able to capitalize on this opportunity to bring the best quality of&nbsp;residential real estate in the city with futuristic design of buildings i.e &ldquo;Shivalik Skyview&rdquo; has its design inspired by a drone, &ldquo;The Curv&rdquo; will have one of its kind curved design in India with ultra-modern amenities to suit the next generation buyers and investors.

In this dynamic environment, industry experts are shedding light on the housing categories poised to capture prospective buyers&#39; attention this year.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sustainable Residences for a Green Future</strong></p>\n\n<p>Millennials, now active participants in the housing market, are attuned to the virtues of sustainable living. This has sparked a surge in the demand for eco-friendly homes. The younger generation meticulously assesses properties based on their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) credentials. Many are willing to invest a five to seven percent premium if it means acquiring a home with superior sustainable amenities and benefits that promise long-term value. Developers quickly recognise this shift and proactively incorporate green elements into their projects. Expect to see properties that boast abundant open spaces adorned with lush greenery, bathed in natural light, and featuring enhanced air and water quality.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Versatile and Opulent Living Spaces</strong></p>\n\n<p>With freelancing, side hustles, and remote work arrangements now commonplace, every family member seeks sanctuary within the home. The evolving work culture has transformed the homebuyer&#39;s mindset, placing a premium on spacious, sustainable, and ultra-modern residences equipped with cutting-edge green technology. Today&#39;s ideal home provides convenient access to recreational opportunities, transportation options, and a robust social infrastructure that caters to the needs of children and senior citizens, complete with nearby schools and healthcare facilities.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, luxurious living is set to make a significant impact this year. There&#39;s a growing demand for homes with mesmerising sea views and expansive outdoor spaces, including balconies, terraces, courtyards, and nearby gardens and parks. Contemporary consumer preferences have shifted from premium real estate to a more sophisticated approach. Buyers desire a lifestyle that seamlessly accommodates remote work while preserving the luxury and comforts of luxurious living.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Driving Forces Behind the Market</strong></p>\n\n<p>Millennials have emerged as a driving force in the real estate sector. Post-pandemic, we&#39;ve witnessed a surge in homebuying among married couples and single millennials, regardless of their marital status or gender. They have been instrumental in propelling the momentum of the real estate market, resulting in record-breaking sales. The pandemic&#39;s uncertainties have amplified the need for homeownership and real estate investment, making millennials the linchpin of the industry&#39;s resurgence.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As the sands of time continue to shift, the Indian residential real estate landscape is evolving to meet the desires and needs of its discerning clientele.

Women&#39;s reservation in politics empowers women at various levels. It not only encourages more women to participate in politics but also inspires women to take on leadership roles in other sectors.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nHaving an all-inclusive work culture in its true sense, the Shivalik group has always been a supporter of women&rsquo;s empowerment. Although Real Estate is perceived as a male-driven industry, the Shivalik group has been changing this mediocre mindset by motivating and promoting women employees to build their careers in the Real Estate industry by offering them key positions in decision-making.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nShivalik group believes the following listed skills that women possess, prove their mettle in any walk of life:</p>\n\n<p>1. Learning attitude:<br />\nScience has shown that girls typically mature more quickly than boys. They not only have a knack for learning, but they also pick things up more quickly.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n2. Prioritizing Integrity:<br />\nWomen never hesitate to take hard steps if those steps do any good to their families. Women with their higher integrity do great in the business world.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n3. Ability to Build Relationships:<br />\nWomen have the ability to build relationships faster, which boosts the chance of their being successful.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n4. Flair for Lean Methodology:<br />\nWhen it comes to lean techniques, women excel. No women consider making a sizable purchase immediately soon, whether using their own funds or those of investors.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n5. Soft Corner for Human Management:<br />\nWomen excel in managing human resources and have a greater grasp of the emotional side of business. This aids in the effective management of both people and the company. Additionally, because of their higher emotional intelligence and intuitive nature, they can successfully arbitrate any conflict in business.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nIt is notable that the Shivalik Institute of Real Estate, established to bridge the skill gap in the Real Estate industry, is led by Mrs. Dipali Shah (W/o Mr. Chitrak Shah, Founder &amp; Chairman, SIRE) as Founder and director, SIRE. &nbsp;In the Parent company, &lsquo;Shivalik&rsquo;, the key position of Sales dept. head are also held by Women Employees.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe group celebrates womanhood by providing a home-like &amp; healthy work environment for women employees to impart a sense of belongingness. Many events and meet-ups are arranged for women employees exclusively to have quality time They are also provided with perks such as Maternity leaves. Women&#39;s power is the backbone at Shivalik and we celebrate it.</p>\n","seo_title":"","seo_description":"","seo_keywords":"","seo_image":"","seo_image_full":"","tags_array":"","tags_commaseparted":"","published_time":1696444200,"published_date":"05 Oct, 2023","created_at_time":1696511459,"date_format":"","date_time":"06:40 PM","created_at_show":{"created_at":"05 Oct, 2023","created_at_time":"06:40 PM"},"updated_at":"","updated_at_time":"","is_active":1,"master_user_id":"1","master_user_id_add":"","is_notify_to_user":"1","is_deleted_request":"0","is_approved":"1","approved_date":"","email_subject":"","email_body":"","added_by":"shivalik group","added_by_type":"admin"},{"share_url":{"website_url":"https://www.shivalikgroup.com/articles/pioneering-sustainable-living-for-a-greener-tomorrow"},"id":189,"project_id":"","page_id":"","joint_page_id":"","slug":"pioneering-sustainable-living-for-a-greener-tomorrow","image":"banner_1696412029_27.jpg","image_full":"https://www.reecosys.com/api/image-tool/index.php?src=https://www.reecosys.com/assets/uploads/blog/banner/banner_1696412029_27.jpg","banner_title":"Pioneering Sustainable Living for a Greener Tomorrow","title":"Pioneering Sustainable Living for a Greener Tomorrow","description":"<p>In an age where climate change is a global concern, it&#39;s imperative to rethink the way we build and live in our homes.
